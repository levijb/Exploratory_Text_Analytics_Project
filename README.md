# Exploratory_Text_Analytics_Project


Convert the collection from their source formats (F0) into a set of tables that conform to the Standard Text Analytic Data Model (F2).
Annotate these tables with statistical and linguistic features using NLP libraries such as NLTK (F3).
Produce a vector representation of the corpus to generate TFIDF values to add to the TOKEN (aka CORPUS) and VOCAB tables (F4).
Model the annotated and vectorized model with tables and features derived from the application of unsupervised methods, including PCA, LDA, and word2vec (F5).
Explore your results using statistical and visual methods.
Present conclusions about patterns observed in the corpus by means of these operations.
