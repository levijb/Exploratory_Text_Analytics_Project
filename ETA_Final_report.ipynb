    "Hip-Hop, a genre of music and cultural movement that emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, has had a significant impact on popular culture since its inception. Born as a counterculture movement in basements and on the streets, Hip-Hop has grown into a global phenomenon that dominates the music industry. Despite its widespread popularity, Hip-Hop has often faced criticism from certain conservative and older communities due to its often-explicit language, crude insinuations, and depictions of immoral or illegal behavior. Despite these criticisms, Hip-Hop's popularity continues to soar, and it has become one of the most influential genres of music in the world. In this project, I will delve into the lyrics of Hip-Hop music to better understand the cultural significance of this ever-evolving art form. Some questions to guide my exploration: which artists have the longest and most unique lyrics, which artists are the most similar, how has lyrical sentiment changed over time, and what are the most popular topics in hip-hop songs?"

There is a separate JSON file for each artist, and these are combined to make a complete corpus. 116 artists were selected from the 80s to present day, and each artist has more than 50 songs and no more than 250. The artists were selected based on popularity rankings from various websites while making sure to include at least 20 artists from each decade, except the 1980's, as hip-hop was just begining to emerge as a genre. I manually created a dictionary to include each artist's hometown and state, and an artist year column was created by taking the median song year for each artist. "

This resulted in 19983 songs, about 89% of the total original songs. the resulting corpus has an average song lyric length of 2614 characters (\\~500 words) and a standard deviation of 947 characters (\\~190 words)."

New York boasts the highest number of artists, as it served as the birthplace of hip-hop and produced a majority of artists in the genre's nascent days. The West coast established its own unique hip-hop culture, distinguished by 'gangsta rap', towards the end of the 1980s and subsequently emerged as the second most prominent region. However, in the 1990's, the ascendancy of southern hip-hop in cities like Atlanta (GA), New Orleans (LA), Miami (FL), Houston (TX), and Memphis (TN) marked a turning point, leading to a more diverse soundscape. Finally, the two major midwestern hip-hop cities, Chicago (IL) and Detroit (MI), bring their respective states near the top of the rankings. \n",

    "This exploratory data analysis project has provided valuable insights into the world of hip-hop music lyrics. The analysis focused on the lyrics of 116 hip-hop artists from the 80s to present day, investigating factors such as the artists' state of origin and top year, lyrical sentiment, and most popular topics. The results suggest that older hip-hop artists tend to use more words per song, and thus have more unique words per song on average, but the proportion of unique words per song is about the same. Both levels of TF-IDF analysis show downward trends which may suggest there are differences in lyrical content between older and newer artists. PCA provides insights into the clustering of hip-hop artists and LDA topic modeling generated 20 topics - the results of both align well with existing knowledge of the genre.  Overall, this project sheds light on the historical evolution and current state of hip-hop music, a genre that has left an indelible mark on popular culture."
